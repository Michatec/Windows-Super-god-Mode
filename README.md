# "Super God Mode" For Windows

This PowerShell script <b>creates shortcuts to all special shell folders, named folders, task links, system settings, deep links, and URL protocols in Windows</b>, providing easy access to a wide range of system settings and features.

It was inspired by the famously nicknamed "God Mode" folder and creates many more shortcuts than even that. 

âž¤ Note: It's not really a "mode", that's just a catchy name. Running this doesn't change any system settings, it just creates a folder containing a ton of shortcuts.

## How to Run:

### Option 1 (Easier): Using .Bat Launcher
1. Download the latest version of the script. (Direct link [here](https://github.com/Michatec/Windows-Super-god-Mode/releases/download/1.2.6/Super_God_Mode.ps1))
2. Download the launcher batch file to the same location. (Direct link [here](https://github.com/Michatec/Windows-Super-god-Mode/releases/download/1.2.6/SuperGodMode-Launcher.bat))
3. Run the batch file.

### Option 2: Manually running

1. Download the latest version of the script. (Direct link [here](https://github.com/Michatec/Windows-Super-god-Mode/releases/download/1.2.6/Super_God_Mode.ps1))
2. Open PowerShell to the directory with the script. (Tip: In File Explorer, just type "PowerShell.exe" into the address bar to open it to that path).
3. Run the following command to allow script execution temporarily for the current session. 
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```
   ^ **Note:** You might see a warning about changing the execution policy, but the `-Scope Process` part ensures that the change is only temporary, and will only apply to that specific PowerShell window, so you can choose to allow. You can read more in [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-5.1#-scope). 
   
5. Run the script:
   ```
   .\Super_God_Mode.ps1
   ```
   - If no parameters are provided, a GUI will appear for easy configuration.
   - You can also run the script with optional parameters (see below).
